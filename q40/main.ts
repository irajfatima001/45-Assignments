// // Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
//  The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing
//   these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
//   Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional 
//   parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line 
//   includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the album’s Object. Make at least one new
//    function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
